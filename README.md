# Hi! My name is Mauricio :mexico:

I'm a young inexperienced software developer who's really eager to learn and improve my skills as a programmer. :computer:

The main subjects I'm interested in besides software development are around the Networking and Cybersecurity, also Videogame Development :video_game: is something I'd like to get my hands on, along with it's sorrounding subjects such as Computer Graphics.
